## PR requirements

We happily welcome contributions to this starter-kit.
We use GitHub Issues to track community reported issues and GitHub Pull Requests for accepting changes.
Please create a PR only if you've created an issue related to it. PRs without a linked issue won't be reviewed.

## Pull Request Process

2. Please create a development branch in it. name this branch as **feat/name-of-your-feature**. For instance feat/dlt
3. After finishing the development, please make that the PR action passes (linter formating).
4. Please describe the PR is 4-5 meaningful sentences. These sentences shall answer 3W questions (What is the problem, What is the impact, What is the solution)
5. Please add tests to your PR. PRs which decrease the coverage metric won't be resolved, unless it's a special case of a big refactoring.
6. All commits shall have a GPG signature verification as per [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).
7. One member of the Starter Kit Management Committee (SKMC) will review the PR.
